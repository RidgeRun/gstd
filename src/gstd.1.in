.TH "GStreamer" "1" "Feb 2010"
.SH "NAME"
gstd - D-Bus controlled daemon to build, run, and control GStreamer pipelines
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBgstd\fR \fI[OPTION...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
\fIgstd\fP is a deamon that builds, runs, and controls \fIGStreamer\fP pipelines
based on D-Bus messages.

Multiple pipelines can be running simultaneously.  Each pipeline is given a
unique identifier to allow client applications to specify which pipeline is
being controlled.

Any number of client applications can be interacting with \fIgstd\fP.  An example
application is \fIgst-client\P.

\fIgstd\fP is intended for production use as a means to separate the media streaming
logic from the rest of the end-user application.  An example is using \fIgstd\fP with
\fIgst-client\fP for automated testing of GStreamer elements.

\fIgstd\fP, with \fIgst-client\fP, is similar to \fIgstd\-launch\fP.  However 
\fIgstd\fP doesn't suffer from the control of existing pipeline limitations inherient to
\fIgstd\-launch\fP.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.l
\fIgstd\fP accepts the following options:
.TP 8
.B  \-\-help
Print help synopsis and available FLAGS

.
.SH "GSTREAMER OPTIONS"
.l
\fIgstd\fP also accepts the following options that are common
to all GStreamer applications:
.TP 8
.B  \-\-gst\-version
Prints the version string of the \fIGStreamer\fP core library.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-gst\-fatal\-warnings
Causes \fIGStreamer\fP to abort if a warning message occurs. This is equivalent
to setting the environment variable G_DEBUG to 'fatal_warnings' (see the
section \fIenvironment variables\fR below for further information).
.TP 8
.B  \-\-gst\-debug=STRING
A comma separated list of category_name:level pairs to specify debugging levels
for each category. Level is in the range 0-5 where 0 will show no messages, and
5 will show all messages. The wildcard * can be used to match category names.

Use \-\-gst\-debug\-help to show category names

Example:
GST_CAT:5,GST_ELEMENT_*:3,oggdemux:5

.TP 8
.B  \-\-gst\-debug\-level=LEVEL
Sets the threshold for printing debugging messages.  A higher level
will print more messages.  The useful range is 0-5, with the default
being 0.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-gst\-debug\-no\-color
\fIGStreamer\fP normally prints debugging messages so that the
messages are color-coded when printed to a terminal that handles
ANSI escape sequences.  Using this option causes \fIGStreamer\fP
to print messages without color. Setting the \fBGST_DEBUG_NO_COLOR\fR
environment variable will achieve the same thing.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-gst\-debug\-disable
Disables debugging.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-gst\-debug\-help
Prints a list of available debug categories and their default debugging level.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-gst\-plugin\-spew
\fIGStreamer\fP info flags to set
Enable printout of errors while loading \fIGStreamer\fP plugins
.TP 8
.B  \-\-gst\-plugin\-path=PATH
Add directories separated with ':' to the plugin search path
.TP 8
.B  \-\-gst\-plugin\-load=PLUGINS
Preload plugins specified in a comma-separated list. Another way to specify
plugins to preload is to use the environment variable GST_PLUGIN_PATH

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
\fBGST_DEBUG\fR
Comma-separated list of debug categories and levels, e.g.
GST_DEBUG=totem:4,typefind:5
.TP
\fBGST_DEBUG_NO_COLOR\fR
When this environment variable is set, coloured debug output is disabled.
.TP
\fBGST_DEBUG_DUMP_DOT_DIR\fR
When set to a filesystem path, store dot files of pipeline graphs there.
.TP
\fBGST_REGISTRY\fR
Path of the plugin registry file. Default is
~/.gstreamer-GST_MAJORMINOR/registry-CPU.xml where CPU is the machine/cpu type
GStreamer was compiled for, e.g. 'i486', 'i686', 'x86-64', 'ppc', etc. (check
the output of "uname -i" and "uname -m" for details).
.TP
\fBGST_REGISTRY_UPDATE\fR
Set to "no" to force GStreamer to assume that no plugins have changed,
been added or been removed. This will make GStreamer skip the initial check
whether a rebuild of the registry cache is required or not. This may be useful
in embedded environments where the installed plugins never change. Do not
use this option in any other setup.
.TP
\fBGST_PLUGIN_PATH\fR
Specifies a list of directories to scan for additional plugins.
These take precedence over the system plugins.
.TP
\fBGST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH\fR
Specifies a list of plugins that are always loaded by default.  If not set, 
this defaults to the system-installed path, and the plugins installed in the
user's home directory
.TP
\fBOIL_CPU_FLAGS\fR
Useful liboil environment variable. Set OIL_CPU_FLAGS=0 when valgrind or
other debugging tools trip over liboil's CPU detection (quite a few important
GStreamer plugins like videotestsrc, audioconvert or audioresample use liboil).
.TP
\fBG_DEBUG\fR
Useful GLib environment variable. Set G_DEBUG=fatal_warnings to make
GStreamer programs abort when a critical warning such as an assertion failure
occurs. This is useful if you want to find out which part of the code caused
that warning to be triggered and under what circumstances. Simply set G_DEBUG
as mentioned above and run the program in gdb (or let it core dump). Then get
a stack trace in the usual way.
.
.SH FILES
.TP 8
~/.gstreamer-GST_MAJORMINOR/registry-*.xml
The xml plugin database; can be deleted at any time, will be re-created
automatically when it does not exist yet or plugins change.
