GStreamer Daemon, also called gstd, is a GStreamer framework fore controlling
audio and video streaming using D-Bus messages. Qt applications, web interfaces,
and GStreamer element test suites show different ways the framework can be
utilized.  GStreamer Daemon is gst-launch on steroids where you can create
a GStreamer pipeline, play, pause, change speed, skip around, and even change
element parameter settings all while the pipeline is active.
